# Youboard
Hello there! Welcome to the dashboard made by [Omwro](https://github.com/omwro) and me!

## Setup and installations
First of all, lets clone the repo. You can do this by opening your command prompt (terminal) and executing the following command:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ItsMeSafak/youboard
```
This creates a copy of the project on you local machine! There may occur an error saying that 'git is unrecognized'. This means that you should install git first. 
- *Installing git: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git*

Open a terminal and execute the following command:
```sh 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
It may be saying things like 'Requirements already satisfied', but thats a good thing. Once you can enter another command in the terminal, that means the installation of the packages is complete. Also in case you add new packages, add them to the requirements.txt file and rerun the same script.

---
## Executing the code
To run the streamlit application locally, simply execute the following command:
```sh
streamlit run main.py
```
After compiling the code, it should tell you that you can view the app in your browser at the URL *http://localhost:8501* or something like that. If not, there may have gone something wrong with the installation of packages. Perhaps rerun the command above.
